Catan
=====
Rules of the Game:
------------------
The object of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain number of Victory Points, which may be earned by building settlements and cities, winning achievements (longest road and largest army), and buying development cards. The game begins with a free for all where all players may place their two free settlements and roads. One road must be connected to each settlement, and the first die roll does not occur until after every player has placed their free items. Next, again as in classic Catan, each player receives his initial resource allocation, consisting of one of each resource for each settlement the player owns adjacent to that resource.

Once this has happened, the dice are rolled. Players receive resources based on the die roll and play proceeds. There is no robber because no individual person is rolling the die. Between die rolls, players may place structures, initiate trades, and buy development cards. Rules for legal structure placement are the same as in classic Catan. Development cards may be played as soon as they are received, and their actions are similar but slightly different than the traditional development card actions.  You cannot see what the development card does before you play it.
